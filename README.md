# Portfolio
Inside this portfolio are the github links to two code samples of mine. One for the backend of a user item collection application. The other for the database of an insurance company. 

# Repository Name: pokemonApp                                                        
Link to repository: https://github.com/alexpowmow/pokemonApp

Inside this repository is the backend of a user item collection application. More specifically, pokemon cards. It contains routes for creating users, JSON web tokens, authentication, pokemon characters, and mapping characters to users. In terms of creating data objects, mongoose is used. Data can be viewed using services such as Robo3T and routes can be tested using Postman. The program can be run using "npm run devStart". Once oeprational, route documentation can view viewed at the following link "http://localhost:5001/api-docs/#/". This documentation was created via SwaggerUI.

# Repository Name: Insurance Database                                            
Link to repository: https://github.com/alexpowmow/InsuranceDatabase

Inside this repository is a program designed to retrieve information from an Insurance company database. I designed the database myself using SQL and created the insuranceDatabase.java file which provides a way for a user to interact with the database. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to my account so there will be no way to log into the databse. However, all of the code is there along with a folder for additions I made in the database, and a pdf of the ER Diagram.
