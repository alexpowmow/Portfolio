# Portfolio
Inside this portfolio are the github links to two code samples of mine. One for the backend of a user item collection application. The other for the database of an insurance company. 

pokemonMongoJWS:
Inside this folder is the backend of a user item collection application. More specifically, pokemon cards. It contains routes for creating users, JSON web tokens, authentication, pokemon characters, and mapping characters to users. In terms of creating data objects, mongoose is used. Data can be viewed using services such as Robo3T and routes can be tested using Postman. The program can be run using "npm run devStart". Once oeprational, route documentation can view viewed at the following link "http://localhost:5001/api-docs/#/". This documentation was created via SwaggerUI.
